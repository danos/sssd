sssd (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Move calls to pam-auth-update from the package scripts in sssd to
    libpam-sss, and correct prerm call to remove the correct pam config.
    Add versioned dependency on libpam-runtime to make sure
    pam-auth-update is available.
  * Add code to the postinst and postrm of libnss-sss to update
    passwd, group and shadow entries in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
  * Make sure init.d/sssd start after $named, to ensure it can look up
    in DNS also when the DNS server is on the local machine.

  [ Morten Werner Forsbring ]
  * New upstream release.

sssd (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Add libsemanage1-dev as build dependency, as it is now required.
    - Drop python-build-with-deb-layout.dpatch, now handled upstream.
    - Adjust provide-default-working-sssd-config-file.dpatch to
      work with new package source layout and config file content.
    - Adjust build rules to cope with server/ changing to src/ in the
      source tarball.
    - Add --enable-krb5-locator-plugin to keep building the plugin.
  * Change the pam-auth-update configuration to make the session
    script optional instead of sufficient, to make sure the other
    session modules are executed too.
  * Change initial pam password entry from requisite to sufficient,
    to make sure local users can have their password set even if
    sssd is enabled.
  * Rename pam-configs/sssd to pam-configs/sss, to have a name that
    is consistent with the package name libpam-sss.
  * Add VCS links to the GIT repository.
  * Move configuration API documentation from /etc/sssd/ to
    /usr/share/doc/sssd/.  It is not configuration and do not belong
    in /etc/.
  * Drop autoconf, automake, libtool, m4 and autotools-dev from
    build-depends.  There is no need to regenerate the build files any
    more.

  [ Morten Werner Forsbring ]
  * Add dnsutils as build-dependency.
