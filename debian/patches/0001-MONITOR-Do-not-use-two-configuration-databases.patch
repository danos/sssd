Subject: [PATCH] MONITOR: Do not use two configuration databases
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

confdb was initialized twice in monitor. The 1st time in
load_configuration and the 2nd time in server_setup.

libldb-1.4.0 contains stricter checking of PID which created db.
    ldb_tdb: Prevent ldb_tdb reuse after a fork()

    We may relax this restriction in the future, but for now do not assume
    that the caller has done a tdb_reopen_all() at the right time.

    Signed-off-by: Andrew Bartlett <abartlet@samba.org>

It did not cause any problem when sssd was stared in interactive mode
(used by systemd) But it causes failures in daemon mode which is used
in cwrap integration
