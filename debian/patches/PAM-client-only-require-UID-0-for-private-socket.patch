Subject: [PATCH] PAM client: only require UID 0 for private socket
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Some privileged services like e.g. gdm might only call with UID 0 but
with a different GID. This patch removes the GID 0 requirement to access
to private PAM socket so that e.g. gdm can use the wait-for-card option.
